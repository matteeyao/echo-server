package main

// Response represents the response from an HTTP request.
//
// The Client and Transport return Responses from servers once
// the response headers have been received. The response body
// is streamed on demand as the Body field is read.
type Response struct {
	Status     string // e.g. "200 OK"
	StatusCode int    // e.g. 200
	Proto      string // e.g. "HTTP/1.0"

	// Header maps header keys to values. If the response had multiple
	// headers with the same key, they may be concatenated, with comma
	// delimiters.  (RFC 7230, section 3.2.2 requires that multiple headers
	// be semantically equivalent to a comma-delimited sequence.) When
	// Header values are duplicated by other fields in this struct (e.g.,
	// ContentLength, TransferEncoding, Trailer), the field values are
	// authoritative.
	//
	// Keys in the map are canonicalized (see CanonicalHeaderKey).
	Header Header

	// Body represents the response body.
	Body string

	// Close records whether the header directed that the connection be
	// closed after reading Body. The value is advice for clients: neither
	// ReadResponse nor Response.Write ever closes a connection.
	Close bool
